## Git Commands

### Merge the main branch into your current branch

when you have merge conflicts and you have deleted what you donâ€™t want and kept what you do want, after this commit the new updates
```{python}
#| eval: false
git pull origin main

git add
```

### Remove a singular branch from your local machine

```{python}
#| eval: false
git branch -d branch-to-delete
```

### Remove all local branches that have been merged or deleted remotely

This is used to remove all local branches that their remote counterparts have either been merged or deleted to clean up your local machine. Feel free to add --dry-run to the end of your git statement to see the result of running it without actually running it.

```{python}
#| eval: false

git fetch --prune
git branch -v|grep "\\[gone\\]"|awk '{print $1}'|xargs -I{} git branch -d {}
```
